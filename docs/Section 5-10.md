# Interpreter Pattern: Business Rule Processing

## Overview
The **Interpreter Pattern** allows businesses to modify business rules **on the fly** without requiring code compilation, testing, and deployment. This provides significant competitive advantage by enabling rapid response to changing business conditions.

## Problem
- Business rules need frequent modification
- Traditional approach (modify → compile → test) takes weeks/months
- Need dynamic rule changes without system downtime

## Solution
Represent conditional expressions as **parse trees** where:
- **Operators** = nonterminal nodes
- **Operands** = terminal nodes  
- **Actions** = list of commands executed when condition evaluates to true

## Key Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Abstract Expression** | Common interface for all expressions |
| **Terminal Expression** | Represents operands (int, boolean, string) |
| **Nonterminal Expression** | Represents operators (+, -, *, /, &&, \|\|) |
| **Context** | Hash table storing objects/values used in expressions |
| **Client** | Builds expression tree and triggers evaluation |

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Define a Grammar
Define expression types: logical, relational, arithmetic expressions

### 2. Construct Class Diagram
Represent grammar hierarchy with eval() methods

### 3. Convert to Parse Tree
Transform conditional expressions into tree structure

**Example:** `"order.qty * product.price > $200 && customer.years > 5"`

### 4. Implement Context
Use hash table to store objects referenced in expressions:
```java
Hashtable h = new Hashtable();
h.put("order", order);
h.put("product", product); 
h.put("customer", customer);
```

### 5. Create and Evaluate Rules
- **Condition**: Conjunction of conditional expressions
- **Action**: List of commands to execute
- **Storage**: Linked list of rules evaluated sequentially

## Benefits
- Easy to change expression grammar
- Rules can be modified dynamically
- Supports multiple semantics for same grammar
- No compilation required for rule changes

## Limitations
- Difficult for complex grammars (C++, Java)
- More classes to implement
- Performance overhead due to interpretation

## When to Use
- Business rules change frequently
- Performance is not critical concern
- Grammar is relatively simple

## Related Patterns
- **Composite**: Store expression trees
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Chain expression trees
- **Command**: Represent actions as commands
- **Observer**: Decouple conditions from actions

## Dynamic Updates
Implement an **edit decision table dialog** that:
- Allows users to update rules through UI
- Replaces existing parse trees with new ones
- Requires no compilation or system restart

## Performance Consideration
Interpretation runs slower than compiled code, but the flexibility for dynamic changes often outweighs performance concerns for business rule processing.
