Objective:
- Reimplement the Daily Operations Dashboard Decision Logic using the Interpreter Pattern, transforming hardcoded conditional rules into a flexible, extensible design.

Instructions:
Step 1 - Individual work

- Review the Specification with its example.
    - Read Section 15.10 on Applying the Interpreter Pattern in your textbook
    - Pay attention to:  
        - AbstractExpression – the common interface for all expressions.
        - TerminalExpression – represents constants or basic rules.
        - NonTerminalExpression – represents composite or conditional rules.
        - Context – stores and manages data for interpretation.

Step 2 - Group Work

- Each group will focus on:
    - Replace the nested if logic with an Interpreter structure that can evaluate rules dynamically.
    - Use expressions to represent at least 3 conditions.
    - Compose higher-level expressions to represent rules such as (Active AND KPIBreach)

Step 3 - Presentations

- Presentations will be split across class sessions
- Each group will have 4 minutes max.
